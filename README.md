Answers to the questions:
1. Itâ€™s not correct as the square brackets are not balanced. There are 2 opening square brackets at the start, but only one closing one at the end. The inner round brackets have balance, but the outer brackets don't.
2. To fix it, we just need to remove one of the opening [ at the beggining or add one more ] at the end to balance things.
